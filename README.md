## Tools used in this project
- SQL
- Python
- Excel
- PowerBi
  
## [Customer Churn Analysis: Predicting Who Might Leave](https://github.com/Husna426/Project/blob/main/customer%20churn%20records.ipynb)

 I built a smart system to predict which customers might stop using our service. This lets us proactively reach out and convince them to stay!

**Uncovering Why They Leave:**

By analyzing data, I understood why customers churn (leave). This helps us prevent future churn.

**Keeping Customers Happy:**

Knowing why customers leave allowed me to create plans to keep them happy. This might involve personalized outreach, fixing problems, or improving our service based on their feedback. The goal is to make them never want to leave!

**The Benefits:**

This data-driven approach helps the company retain valuable customers, making it a win-win for everyone!

**Technologies:**

- Python (Data analysis & visualization)
- Libraries: Pandas (Data manipulation), NumPy (Numerical computing), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)

**Tasks:**

- Import libraries and load data
- Clean and preprocess data
- Conduct exploratory data analysis
- Draw conclusions and insights

## [HR Analytics Visualization: Making Data Meaningful](https://github.com/Husna426/Project/blame/main/HR%20Analytics.pbix)

The organization strives to improve employee engagement and retention. Tons of data exist, but it can be overwhelming. I need to turn this data into something clear.

**Taking Action:**

- **Data Collection:** Gather relevant HR data (payroll, performance reviews, employee surveys). Clean and organize it for a clear story.
- **Visual Storytelling:** Use Power BI to create compelling visuals like charts and maps. These data snapshots reveal trends and patterns. Interactive features allow further exploration.
- **From Data to Decisions:** Analyze the data stories to see the big picture. What are employee demographic patterns? How's performance connected to turnover? Valuable insights will be revealed.
- **Clear Communication:** Share insights with HR leadership and stakeholders using Power BI visualizations. Everyone will be on the same page regarding employee engagement and retention.

## [Employee Data Analytics: Uncovering Hidden Gems](https://github.com/Husna426/Project/blob/main/HR%20data%20query.sql)

I am on a mission to find hidden gems in our employee data! Using a powerful tool called SQL, I'll analyze details like ages, job titles, pay, and performance reviews.

**Extracting Insights:**

By combining and filtering this information, we can uncover patterns and trends. Imagine seeing how many people of each age work in different departments, or how salaries compare across different roles. This provides a clearer picture of our workforce, helping HR improve processes and keep employees happy.

## [ESG Analytics: Unveiling Sustainability Impact](https://github.com/Husna426/Project/blob/main/ESG%20data%20analytics%20project%20(3).ipynb)

Let's unlock the secrets of a company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impact! We'll use Python, a powerful programming language, to analyze ESG data.

**Our Toolbox:**

- Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation & analysis)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)

**The Process:**

- **Data Gathering:** I collected ESG data from reports, rating agencies, and government databases. Python's cleaning capabilities ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Data Analysis:** I used Python to analyze data, identify trends, and uncover patterns. This might involve analyzing carbon footprint reduction, diversity within the workforce, or the effectiveness of governance practices.
- **Data Visualization:**  visualizations showcase ESG performance in a clear and engaging way.
- **The Outcome:** I gathered insights to develop a data-driven sustainability engagement strategy.
